# Debugging practice

This repository is a way for me to practice my debugging skills. I have pulled various files that need to be debugged, starting simple, and building in complexity.

## Objectives

- Get used to the process of debugging.
- Practice tightening the loop (finding where the bug is).
- Practice creating visibility (Using print statements to check outcomes against expectations).
- Practice resolving the bugs once I have followed the above steps.

## Features

- Different files that have been debugged.
- Using checkout you can view the file  before it was bug fixed.

## Language used

- Ruby

## Conclusion

Debugging is a fundamental concept, hence, it is in the first week of the Makers course. This repository is a way to catalogue the debugging exercises that I am practicing.
